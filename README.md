# IncidentGuard – Smart Incident Prevention Agent

IncidentGuard is an AI-powered incident prevention agent built using **IBM watsonx Orchestrate**.  
It proactively analyzes system signals, validates incident risk using a review agent, and automatically generates operational incident summaries.

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Modern enterprise systems generate large volumes of metrics, logs, and alerts. Incidents are often detected only after customer impact has occurred, leading to outages, SLA breaches, and delayed response.

## 💡 Solution Overview
IncidentGuard applies agentic AI to detect early incident risks and support operational decision-making.

- IncidentGuard Agent: Analyzes system signals and classifies incident risk.
- RiskReview Agent: Independently validates the risk classification and recommended actions.
